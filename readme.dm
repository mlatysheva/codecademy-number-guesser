This is a simple project from Codecademy's Full-Stack Engineer Course.
It is a number-guessing game.
A target number between 0 and 9 is guessed. You take a guess and the computer takes a guess.
Whoever gets closer to the target number, wins.
If the user and the computer guess the same number, the user wins.
